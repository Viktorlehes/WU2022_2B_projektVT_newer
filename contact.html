          Unfortunately, due to extenuating circumstances, some international orders may get stopped by the customs agency in your country. Please read our full customs disclaimer:
          CUSTOMS DISCLAIMER: We will not be responsible for any customs restrictions, tariffs, or other regulations that may apply in countries outside the United States. If you have any questions, we encourage you to speak with your customs office directly. We do not keep track of all the changing laws in all the different countries, although we will ship any products you order to the address you provide. It's your responsibility to check with your country's Customs office to see if your country allows the shipment of products you ordered (or wish to order) to your country.
          We will give you the best service and ship the products you order very quick at the rates that we have agreed to on our site. If for whatever reason the package is seized by Customs Officials, we will not issue you a refund unless all products are returned to us in resalable condition. Most orders make it through customs fine and the majority of orders that are stopped are returned to us. You are ultimately responsible for any shipping charges regardless of the outcome. You pay shipping charges based on the weight of the package and shipping type selected.
          Any duties or taxes that may apply to the order are your responsibility to pay.
          By ordering from our site you are stating that you agree to our ordering policies and FAQ.
